Using the given corpora from three different domains, we first evaluate the reference Unigram implementation provided in the starter code in Section 2. Then we propose our Trigram approach in Section 3, with the implementation details explained inSection 3.1. We show that our approach outperforms the Unigram baseline in almost every performance metric, in Section 3.2 and 3.3. Finally we explore the possibility of adapting our language model from one corpus to another, and demonstrated significant improvement in perplexity in Section 4. Finally we conclude our report in Section 5.\nFor the Content-aware Language Model experiments, we implemented a generic N-gram model with two optimizations:\n Interpolation: The probability estimates from N-gram down to unigram are mixed and weighted (3.1.1), and the the weights λs are dynamically tuned using EM Algorithm (3.1.2). Smoothing: Instead of using Laplace Smoothing (add-1), we added hyper-parameter k and implemented Add-k Smoothing, with k being tuned on a dev set (3.1.3). Low frequency cut-off: Taking a parameter min_freq, we remove all the rare item in vocab and treat them as “UNK”  ","date":1651045979,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1651045979,"objectID":"3ddc9ca93a0c2cad65f15dd4594f2438","permalink":"https://rongyi.ai/zh/report/cse256-a3-report/","publishdate":"2022-05-04T15:52:59+08:00","relpermalink":"/zh/report/cse256-a3-report/","section":"report","summary":" ","tags":["N-Gram","Unigram","Bigram","Trigram","EM Algorithm"],"title":"CSE256 Assignment 3: Language Modeling","type":"report"},{"authors":["荣懿"],"categories":["NLP","Machine Learning"],"content":"In this report, we discuss the various ways of data pre-processing and feature engineering for a text classification task.

Classical results show that $\\vec w*$ can be recovered within the $\\ell_2$-reconstruction error $O(\\sqrt{k/n})$, where $n$ is the number of truncated/observable samples, and $k$ is the dimension of $\\vec w^*$. However, this kind of classic technique does not apply to partially observable data, namely, the truncated setting. Analysis from truncated samples is one of the biggest challenge in today\u0026rsquo;s life cause truncation always happened whenever samples not in the bound are not observed. This kind of case is very common in biological search, social science, business and economics field either due to the limitation of data collecting device or inherit flaws of sampling processes. If we ignore the truncation, as shown in various experiments, the regression result shows very limited generalization property under regions where data is missing. Recently, a series of work (See) has lead to theoretically sound truncated linear regression with optimal sample complexity since the challenge was introduced in 1958. While these are all polynomial-time algorithms, their run-time is far-from being practical due to some complicated projection steps that rely heavily on the ellipsoid methods. On the other hand, these works often assume that the data truncation is arbitrary and only oracle access to the truncation set is provided while, in practice, the censoring setting, where the truncation set is convex, is more ubiquitous.\nOur Contributions. In this work, we give an efficient truncated linear-regression algorithm tailored for the censoring setting. The run-time of the algorithm is in the worst case bounded by $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the input data-size, and is on-average better when the data follows certain structured distributions, showing that truncated linear regression can be practical.\n","date":1647330779,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1647330779,"objectID":"86c032843a8b71c42e79de366889c750","permalink":"https://rongyi.ai/zh/report/cse203b-report/","publishdate":"2020-08-04T15:52:59+08:00","relpermalink":"/zh/report/cse203b-report/","section":"report","summary":" ","tags":["DQN","Data Parallelism","Theory","Regression","Truncated Linear Regression"],"title":"CSE203B: Linear Regression under Interval Truncation","type":"report"},{"authors":["荣懿"],"categories":["Statistics","Machine Learning"],"content":"In this report, we discuss our attempt to use a better strategy to pick the direction of coordinate descent at each step rather than random selection.

Current approaches (e.g., data/model parallelism, pipeline parallelism) parallelize training tasks onto multiple devices. However, these approaches always rely on specific deep learning frameworks and requires elaborate manual design, which make it difficult to maintain and share between different type of models. In this paper, we propose Auto-MAP, a framework for exploring distributed execution plans for DNN workloads, which can automatically discovering fast parallelization strategies through reinforcement learning on IR level of deep learning models. Efficient exploration remains a major challenge for reinforcement learning. We leverage DQN with task-specific pruning strategies to help efficiently explore the search space including optimized strategies. Our evaluation shows that Auto-MAP can find the optimal solution in two hours, while achieving better throughput on several NLP and convolution models.","tags":["DQN","Data Parallelism","Sharding","Pipeline Parallelism","Deep Reinforcement Learning"],"title":"Auto-MAP: A DQN Framework for Exploring Distributed Execution Plans for DNN Workloads","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiqing Fan","荣懿","Chen Meng","Zongyan Cao","Siyu Wang","Zhen Zheng","Chuan Wu","Guoping Long","Jun Yang","Lixue Xia","Lansong Diao","Xiaoyong Liu","Wei Lin"],"categories":["Distributed Training"],"content":"","date":1587116639,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1625243726,"objectID":"05daecc5d055500ea8dfe66351360d19","permalink":"https://rongyi.ai/zh/publication/dapple/","publishdate":"2020-04-17T17:43:59+08:00","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/dapple/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose DAPPLE, a synchronous training framework which combines data parallelism and pipeline parallelism for large DNN models.
